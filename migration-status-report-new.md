## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Missing functionality from original app | High | Medium | Thorough review of original app features |
| Performance issues with React | Medium | Low | Code splitting, lazy loading, and performance optimization |
| Learning curve for team | Medium | Medium | Documentation and knowledge sharing sessions |
| Integration with existing data sources | Medium | Medium | Create adapter functions to work with existing data |

## Notes
- All production code will remain unmodified until the new implementation is complete
- Changes will only be committed to the feature branch
- Regular status updates will be added to this document
